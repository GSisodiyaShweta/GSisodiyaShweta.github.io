            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a Computational Media Ph.D. student in the Interaction Dynamics Lab at UC Santa Cruz.
                I earned my bachelor's and master's in Applied Mathematics from the Indian Insitute of Technology
                Roorkee (IITR, India) in 2018.
                I served as Data Science Analyst (full-time) at Accenture (India) for three years before joining UC
                Santa Cruz.
                I am primarily interested in user experience, game user research, and Interactive Narrative. Currently,
                my focus is player agency and visualizing it in the context of game narrative.
                Much of the motivation is to gain insights into how player agency allows players to make different
                choices compared to other players or communities.

            <h3><a href="#">Shibu</a></h3>
            <p>There exists a spectrum of gender identities in this world.
                Fostering gender-biased communication, regardless of setting, can ingrain unconscious biases.
                Thus, as a community we should promote Gender-Inclusive Language (GIL) as a good social practice.As a
                community we have begun making small but
                measurable efforts to recognize the gender — instituting GIL in communications. At present community
                introduces
                GIL via seminars, workshops, blog posts, videos, animations, etc. Undoubtedly, such platforms are
                excellent for abstract conceptualization.
                However, when it comes to communication, such platforms are mere warm-ups. There is a need for an
                interactive
                platform that encourages individuals to learn and practice GIL holistically.<br><br>

                To highlight this gap between insitutionalization and implementation of GIL, we present
                <Strong>SHIBU</Strong>. Research suggest that the first step towards adopting more Gender-Inclusive
                Language is simply bringing
                awareness around this topic and getting familiar with pronouns. Shibu is an interactive chatbot game,
                that highlights the inappropriate use of gender pronouns.

            <h3><a href="#">Project Resilience</a></h3>
            <p>

                Resilience, the ability of a person to manage their own anxiety and cope with a changing environment,
                is a key psychological construct that is becoming increasingly salient in light of the COVID-19
                pandemic, extreme weather events and political and social unrest.
                Previous work in psychology and organizational psychology focused on measuring resilience as a trait and
                determining factors that affect it.Addtionally previous work is limited methodologically to surveys,
                which rely on self-report and do not measure such dynamic aspects of resilience. Our novel approach uses
                Alternate Reality Games (ARGs), to address this research gap.

            <p style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: -12px;"> This course offers a survey of ways to understand and
                approach design, toward increasing your creative repertoire and giving you some broader context for your
                practice in designing interactive media. Topics include design thinking, values in design, critical
                design practice, and envisioning practices.<br>
                Course Objectives <br>
                ● Read about and understand a range of approaches to design.<br>
                ● Practice applying these approaches. <br>
                ● Enhance and deepen design, presentation, discussion, teamwork, and reflection skills.<br>
